## Notes
Why I did certain things

get the data in console log

first Get the data on teh screen which turned out to be very pesky because the exampel uses https and I was using that and I learned the ahrd way that http from outside

plan a better layout for the data ui

Convert the rating into a visual presentation  chose to use stars withi a basic idea of taking the width as a percent from the given number.  so 4.9 turned into 98%.  x 10 x 2 and concat %

use moment to covnert the date into something more pleasant - used react moment which cleans up the code a bit

first tried to just make sure I could click on each name and get a review back so I did that next.  


5. get the average of all the ratings. and since it was 2.754000000013 I have now roudn or cut it off  to Fixed rounded up
