## Notes
This application is based on the real world application to the following problem: Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn't have the chops to finish out the UI. That's where you come in, your task is to build a client side app for Shakespeare's API. (open ended design I went with applying it to Hale Center Theater's site since they currently have no reviews showing)

## Tech
React, APIs, axios, testing software Jest/Enzyme
